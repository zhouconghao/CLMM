The LSST-DESC Cluster Lensing Mass Modeling (CLMM) code is a DESC tool consisting of a Python library for performing galaxy cluster mass reconstruction from weak lensing observables. CLMM is associated with Key Tasks _DC1 SW+RQ_ and _DC2 SW_ of the LSST-DESC [Science Roadmap](https://lsstdesc.org/sites/default/files/DESC_SRM_V1_4.pdf) pertaining to absolute and relative mass calibration.
<!---CLMM is descended from [clmassmod](https://github.com/deapplegate/clmassmod) but distinguished by its modular structure and scope, which encompasses both simulated data sets with a known truth and observed data from which we aim to discover the truth.--->
The documentation of the code can be found [here](http://lsstdesc.org/CLMM/) and the overview of the code can be found [here](OVERVIEW.md).
The journal paper that describes the development and validation of `CLMM` v1.0 can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.6092A/abstract). If you make use of the ideas or software here, please cite that paper and provide a
link to this repository: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM. Please follow the guidelines listed below to install, use and contribute to CLMM.

# Installing CLMM <a name="installing"></a>

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

CLMM requires Python version 3.8 or later.  CLMM has the following dependencies:

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) (v1.17 or later)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (v1.3 or later)
- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) (v4.0 or later for units and cosmology dependence)  
(Please avoid Astropy v5.0 since there is bug breaking CCL backend. It has been fixed in Astropy v5.0.1.)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plotting and going through tutorials)

```
  pip install numpy scipy astropy matplotlib
```

For the theoretical predictions of the signal, CLMM relies on existing libraries and **at least one of the following must be installed as well**:

- [cluster-toolkit](https://cluster-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CCL](https://ccl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (versions between 2.6.0 and 2.7.1.dev9+g1a351df6)
- [NumCosmo](https://numcosmo.github.io/) (v0.15 or later)


(See the [INSTALL documentation](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation instructions.)

For developers, you will also need to install:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) (3.x or later for testing)
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) (for documentation)

These are also pip installable:
```
  pip install pytest sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```
Note, the last item, `sphinx_rtd_theme` is to make the docs.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To install CLMM you currently need to build it from source:

```
  git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM.git
  cd CLMM
  python setup.py install --user   # Add --user flag to install it locally
```
See the [INSTALL documentation](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation instructions.

To run the tests you can do:

  `pytest`

# Using CLMM <a name="using"></a>

This code has been released by DESC, although it is still under active
development. You are welcome to re-use the code, which is open source and available under
terms consistent with our
[LICENSE](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM/blob/main/LICENSE) ([BSD
3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)). In this case,
don't forget to reference the [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.6092A/abstract)
and the [repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM).
If you use CLMM for a project, please see the guidelines below, depending on your case.

**DESC Projects**: External contributors and DESC members wishing to
use CLMM for DESC projects should consult with the DESC Clusters analysis
working group (CL WG) conveners, ideally before the work has started, but
definitely before any publication or posting of the work to the arXiv.

**Non-DESC Projects by DESC members**: If you are in the DESC
community, but planning to use CLMM in a non-DESC project, it would be
good practice to contact the CL WG co-conveners and/or the CLMM Topical
Team leads as well (see Contact section).  A desired outcome would be for your
non-DESC project concept and progress to be presented to the working group,
so working group members can help co-identify tools and/or ongoing development
that might mutually benefit your non-DESC project and ongoing DESC projects.

**External Projects by Non-DESC members**: If you are not from the DESC 
community, you are also welcome to contact CLMM Topical Team leads to introduce 
your project and share feedback.
